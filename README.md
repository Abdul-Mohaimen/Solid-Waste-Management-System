# Solid-Waste-Management-System
Our project aims to create a comprehensive waste management platform that offers services for recycling not only solid waste but also various electronic items and appliances. By directly connecting customers with recycling industries, we intend to streamline waste management processes while reducing environmental impact. Additionally, we will introduce a community option within the platform to empower university students to raise awareness about responsible waste disposal in their respective communities.
